This repository will hold all relevant files for the Specific Pet web app.

### Problem Statement

Aspiring pet adopters must consider many different factors when deciding which kind of pet is suitable for their personal circumstance. For example, some people aren't allowed to own dogs where they live. Other people have allergies to pets with fur. Some people own a home with a big backyard while others do not. As such, there are sometimes limitations as to which types of pets any prospective pet adopter is able to own.

Specific Pet gives users the ability to search for pets by weight, breed, age, weight, color, and pattern. This will allow users to find a pet that is in alignment with their wants and needs. And with an easy-to-use interface, your ideal pet is only a few clicks away!
