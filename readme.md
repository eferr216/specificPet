### Problem Statement

Aspiring pet adopters must consider many different factors when deciding which kind of pet is suitable for their personal circumstance. Some people have allergies to pets with fur, others do not. Some people own a home with a backyard, others do not. As such, there are sometimes limitations as to which types of pets any prospective pet adopter is able to own.

Specific Pet gives users the ability to search by weight, breed, age, weight, color, and pattern. This will allow users to find a pet that is in congruence with their wants and/or needs. And with an easy-to-use interface, your ideal pet is only a few clicks away!
